# Boolean Project - Information Retrieval - Marta Tosolini

## Main Functionalities

Write an IR system able to answer:

• Boolean queries with AND, OR, and NOT.

• Wildcard and phrase queries.

• Some normalisation or stemming can be performed (for stemming you can use a library)

• You can implement spelling correction.

• Evaluate the system on a set of test queries.

## Libraries

**numpy**, **pandas**, **nltk** libraries must be installed to run the programs


## How to run the System

1. **Main Version** with the dataset already chosen.
Run **main.py** to execute the program.

2. **Input Dataset Version** in which you have to put in input the location of the dataset, and the column of the dataset that will be used to create the index.
Run **main_input_dataset.py** to execute the program.

3. **Tests**: There are three different kind of tests that were used to test the system (originally created on jupyter notebook):
**Functionalities** (test if the program actually works), **Effectiveness** (precision and recall measures), **Performance** (timing measures).
Tests can be run on **jupyter notebook**
